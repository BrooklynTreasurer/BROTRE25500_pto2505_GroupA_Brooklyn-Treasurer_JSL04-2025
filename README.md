## 📝 Project Description  
The **JSL04: Dynamic Task Display & Modal View** project is a JavaScript-powered application that allows users to **view, manage, and edit tasks directly in the browser DOM**.  

Building on previous Kanban board iterations, this version introduces **dynamic task rendering, interactive modals, and real-time updates**. Tasks are automatically placed in their correct columns: `"To Do"`, `"In Progress"`, and `"Done"`.  

Clicking on a task opens a **modal view**, allowing users to edit the **title**, **description**, and **status**, with changes immediately reflected on the board.  

This project highlights expertise in **DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript, event handling, and responsive UI design**.

## 🎯 Key Objectives  

- ✅ Dynamically generate **task elements** from initial task data  
- ✅ Insert tasks into **correct columns** based on their status  
- ✅ Enable **modal view** when a task is clicked  
- ✅ Allow **editing** of task title, description, and status in the modal  
- ✅ Update the board **in real-time** when changes are made  
- ✅ Implement **responsive modal design** matching Figma layout, with backdrop focus  
- ✅ Maintain **modular, clean, and well-documented code** using descriptive variable/function names and JSDoc comments
