## 📝 Project Description  
The **Task Input & Status Validation System (JSL03)** is a JavaScript-powered project that allows users to add, manage, and validate tasks directly through the **browser console**.  
It builds upon the corrected **Kanban Board (JSL01)** foundation, expanding its logic with **dynamic task creation, validation, and user feedback**.  

Users can input multiple tasks, each containing a title, description, and status.  
Once the maximum task limit is reached, the program provides an alert and displays all tasks neatly in the console.  
This project demonstrates a strong understanding of **JavaScript arrays, objects, prompts, loops, and data validation**.

## 🎯 Key Objectives  

- ✅ Store all tasks as **objects** inside an **array** (`initialTasks`)  
- ✅ Add up to **3 new tasks** through user prompts  
- ✅ Assign each new task a **unique incremental ID**  
- ✅ Prompt the user for **title**, **description**, and **status**  
- ✅ Validate task status (`todo`, `doing`, or `done`) and re-prompt until valid  
- ✅ Alert the user once the **maximum task limit (6)** is reached  
- ✅ Log **all tasks** clearly in the console with the label `"All Tasks:"`  
- ✅ Log **completed tasks** (status = `done`) with the label `"Completed Tasks:"`  
- ✅ Use **clear variable names** and **descriptive comments** throughout the code
